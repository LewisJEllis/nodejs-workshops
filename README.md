# NodeJS Workshops

A series of three 2-hour talks/workshops which I gave as the main part of [CodeWeekend](http://the-dining-philosophers.github.io/code-weekend/), leading up to the Fall 2014 PennApps hackathon. They were preceded by a workshop (not given by me) covering installation, setup, using the command line, and some basic HTML/CSS/JS. You can probably find video recordings [here](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD_kZii-CegibJ3b36Xo1Eg).

The three talks were on:

Intro to Node.js
  * Node.js basics
  * Express
  * Templates, sessions, middlewares
  * Simple form processing

Intro to APIs
  * What APIs are, how they work, why we use them
  * Sending HTTP requests from Node
  * Authenticating with an API via OAuth
  * Sending emails and Venmo payments

Intro to MongoDB
  * MongoDB: what, why, how, basic commands
  * MongoDB with Node: why, how
  * Saving and retrieving notes and payments from Node

The workshops build on each other and the materials include milestones/checkpoints in the progression of the code. These materials will likely be reused and/or adapted in the future for similar applications.
